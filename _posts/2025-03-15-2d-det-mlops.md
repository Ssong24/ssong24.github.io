## Project Overview
 Built a full-stack optimization pipeline transforming prototypes into deployable ML services. Designed a reproducible workflow from local experimentation to AWS-hosted API with Terraform, MLflow, and Prefect.

## Key Contribution
- 🔁 Automated model training, registration, and staging with MLflow registry
- 📦 Containerized models and APIs using Docker and GitHub Actions CI/CD
- 🌩️ Deployed optimized model endpoints on AWS EC2 with HTTPS + Nginx
- 📈 Integrated Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for monitoring latency and cost
- 🧠 Scheduled nightly Evidently AI checks for model drift detection


#### Skills
- Language: Python
- Tools: Docker, Terraform, MLflow, Prefect, Prometheus, Grafana
- Cloud: AWS EC2, S3, ECR, IAM
- Frameworks: FastAPI
