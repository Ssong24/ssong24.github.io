#### Abstract
Accurate object detection from wide-angle views is essential for advanced autonomous driving. Fisheye lens cameras are useful in this context but introduce heavy radial distortion â€” objects in the center appear larger, while those near the edges look smaller.
To address this, we propose Expandable Spherical Projection, which selectively expands the center or edge regions of fisheye images. This helps straighten object edges and reduce background noise in bounding boxes.
We also explore multi-scale feature fusion in real-time object detection using three variations of a YOLOv3-SPP architecture, designed to better detect small objects.
