Textures 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes from 2D images and camera poses.  Given as input a mesh(.ply) and camera poses, apply partitioning the mesh into planes and rendering the model under given poses, and generates vertex visibility data per frame. Based on partition result a cluster-plane index files and vertex visibility, generate texture patch by mapping each clustered plane with one camera view.

Retorts have the "cap" and the "cucurbit" made into one. The anbik is also called the ra æs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.
