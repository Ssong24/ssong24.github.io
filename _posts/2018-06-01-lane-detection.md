## Project Overview
Developed a lane detection algorithm for autonomous driving systems using OpenCV computer vision techniques. The system captures and processes lane information from side and rear perspectives using vision sensors, enabling robust lane detection even in challenging lighting conditions.

## Key Contribution
- Implemented lane detection algorithm using image filtering approaches
- Designed Region of Interest (ROI) selection for enhanced accuracy
- Improved detection rates in dark and low-visibility environments using Sobel edge detection, gradient magnitude/direction analysis, and HLS color space thresholding
- Validated system performance through real-world road testing
