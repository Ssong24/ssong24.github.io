#### Abstract
This study aims to develop a lane detection algorithm for autonomous driving using OpenCV by capturing lanes from the side and rear using a vision sensor.
The study emphasizes improving detection performance by adjusting image color, brightness, and selecting an appropriate region of interest (ROI). Testing on real-road images confirmed improved lane detection, even under low-light conditions.
