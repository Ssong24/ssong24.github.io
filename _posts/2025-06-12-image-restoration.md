Image Restoration
Implemented a real-time image super-resolution pipeline to enhance low-resolution images by generating high-frequency details. The system is based on Real-ESRGAN, which restores sharp, de-noised images while preserving structure and content. The project focused on optimizing the model for deployment using NCNN and Vulkan, enabling efficient inference on edge devices.

Key Contributions

- Researched state-of-the-art super-resolution methods
- Evaluated both open-source models and commercial APIs
- Set up mobile-friendly inference environment with NCNN and Vulkan
