## Project Overview
Developed a real-time radar viewer system for autonomous vehicles that processes 24 GHz FM/CW radar sensor data and displays surrounding environment information in a 2D bird's-eye view interface.

## Key Contribution
- Implemented CAN message parsing using SocketCAN 
- Created real-time 2D visualization to display radar measurements
- Validated radar measurements using camera sensor data.
