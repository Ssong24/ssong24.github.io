## Project Overview
Developed a real-time radar viewer system for autonomous vehicles that processes 24 GHz FM/CW radar sensor data and displays surrounding environment information in a 2D bird's-eye view interface.

## Key Contribution
- Implemented CAN message parsing using SocketCAN (Linux-based CAN protocol implementation)
- Utilized Controller Area Network (CAN) for radar sensor data transmission
- Created real-time 2D visualization to display radar measurements
- Integrated camera sensor verification to confirm radar measurement accuracy
